# 1D finite difference discretizations
This small library was initially written during a course on computation fluid dynamics.
Since I've rewritten these functions a bunch of times for different courses I thought it would be nice to have one repository containing multiple discretization methods.
Another goal of this library is learning to use Matlab's unit testing framework.
